# 3-column-preview-card-component
This project is a simple 3 column preview card component, I created this using webpack for bundling files.
I've used webpack to integrate sass, postcss, htmlwebpackplugin, tree shaking, MiniCssExtractPlugin, devtool, 
html-loader, and I've also made three configuration files, one for production, one for development, 
and one for common, which will be used for both production and development.

Thankyou.
